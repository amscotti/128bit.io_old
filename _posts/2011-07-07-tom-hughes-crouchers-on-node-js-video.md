One of the things I forgot to talk about in my "[A look in to nodeJS]({% post_url 2011-06-29-a-look-in-to-nodejs %})" posting was what originally got me looking at nodejs. I had been seeing nodejs pop up here and there and I kind of wanted to learn more about it, but it wasn't really on the top of my list. I always check www.thriftebook.com to see if there are any new deals for ebooks. Sometimes, O'Reilly has deals that you can get videos too. I picked up the [Tom Hughes-Croucher on Node](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920017080), I want to say after 1/3 of the way of watching the videos I had nodejs installed and was messing around with my own stuff. The videos are really great.

Out of the 3 video series I got from O'Reilly this has been my favorite and really gotten me pumped up about nodejs. I think Tom did a great job of showing off nodejs and his own passion for it. It's that type of person that gets me looking into new technology that I may have overlooked. I would highly recommend this video to anyone looking to get started with nodejs or anyone who just wants to know more about the ideas behind nodejs.

If you want kind of a preview of what the videos are like check out [GTUG - Node.js special](http://vimeo.com/25069201).

Got anymore great nodejs resources that you want to share? Know something else I should look in to? Feel free to write a comment.
