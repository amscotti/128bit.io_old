My web hosting company is doing some upgrades for all their clients and moving them to newer more powerful servers. Being an employee of them I get to see a lot of the back end work that is involved with the upgrades. Not too many people can say they have seen the server their website is hosted on. Along with seeing the work that goes on I was picked as the guinea pig to to test the new servers out. For a bit of time 128bitstudios.com was the only site on the new server! :)

Beside better hardware we have the newest versions of PHP, mySQL and a lot of other tools. Due to this, we are slowly moving people over and giving them time to test their sites before things are finalized to make sure nothing breaks in the move.
