I haven't posted in sometime due to being so busy with a mix of work and getting things ready for my wedding. Truthfully, by the time I sit down Â in front of my own computer, I just want to veg out and watch some TV shows before heading to bed. As soon as I have some free time I'll start writing some more tech based postings. You may see some photos pop up from New Zealand and Australia if I take any that I find good!

I do have a friend at work that always reminds me that I should take a break away from the computer and work. On one of my walks around Salem I stopped at Derby Wharf, here is a photo that just seem to come out just right. The ship is call Friendship and is a reconstruction of a 171-foot three-masted Salem East Indiaman built in 1797. This photo was taken from my Nexus One! More info about the ship can be found at [Salem Massachusetts - Friendship Overview](http://www.salemweb.com/frndship/)
