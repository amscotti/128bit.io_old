So, as the title says, I've moved on to a new job. I've been focusing on learning things to help me at my new job, which hasn't really given me time to sit down and write a new posting for the blog. I'm sorry about this and I hope to have something soon after this transition period is over and things become normal for me.

I did get to buy some videos from O'Reilly, the "[Mastering Grails 101](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024798.do)" by Berglund and McCullough and "[Agile Engineering Practices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020271.do)" by Neal Ford. I'm hoping to sit down and watch them this weekend and maybe write up a review posting for them.
