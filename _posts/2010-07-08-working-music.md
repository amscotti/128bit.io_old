I would never call myself an expert of music.  I know very little of what it takes to make a song let alone what it takes to make an album. But I do know what I like and I do enjoy sharing my thoughts on new bands that I have discovered. When at work coding along, I like to listen to things that have little to no vocals or something where the beats are out doing the vocals. I find music like this helps me get into my zone and lets me focus on my project. (Now if I could just keep people from bugging me I be all set! kidding...kind of! :) ) Though time to time I do listen to things with strong vocals but it just didn't get me in to the zone as I'm always following along with the lyrics.

Last week I found a new album that fits i to what I'm look for as I'm working, [Collide by Beats Antique](http://www.amazon.com/Collide/dp/B001F87CKC/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1278632596&amp;sr=301-1). It was recommended to me by Amazon MP3, based off of some Abney Park albums I bought.  If you are like me, you will enjoy this album as it has a good variety of songs with very few vocals (none except for 1 song). I haven't looked at any of the other albums by this artist, but I soon will.

Also for the people that haven't tried Amazon MP3 yet, it's a great service that I like better than iTunes. Dealing with just MP3 files makes it so much easier to move files around and back them up the way you want to.
