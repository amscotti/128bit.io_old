Hello and welcome to 128-bit Studios!

###About the Site and a Little About Myself

Iâ€™m a software developer who works in all different types of technology. I like to consider myself a jack of all trades but master of none. I, like others in my field, have used the internet to research and solve problems. This site is something that I can give back to the development community to help others find solutions to their problems and maybe help someone start up a new project. Here you will find personal projects I post about to expand my own knowledge, and also a documentation of some of the work I do, along with some of my personal interests. In this field there are many ways to write and develop code, this site is a collection of ideas from which I hope people will comment on and express their own ideas and opinions from their experiences.
